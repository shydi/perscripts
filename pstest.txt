1)  There is a business request for a script to take some arguments and retrieve some attributes based 
on the arguments. Upon further prompting, it is revealed that the Accounting department wants to charge 
users back for long distance calling from work phones. Luckily, both the user’s phone number and user’s 
biographical data (eg. Name, department) is stored in Microsoft Active directory.
Please write a script that takes a phone number as an argument and returns back the username and department, 
and phone number of the corresponding user to the console.

2)  Now that you have demonstrated your ability to write PowerShell scripts, the accounting department has 
gotten greedy. They want the ability to make an excel spreadsheet with phone numbers and get a report of the 
data you returned above. You negotiated down to getting a CSV of numbers and generating a CSV of the data to 
the directory the file you were given was.

3)  The CFO has been fired for embezzling thousands of dollars through a complicated scheme involving 1-900 
numbers, and now the board wants to make sure this never happens again. To make sure of this they have purchased 
a whiz-bang appliance that does AI and ML to inspect call traffic patterns to find signs of malicious activity. 
This appliance accepts data input via a simple REST API that takes a HTTP POST with a Name, a phone number, and a 
department. As the phone system cost accounting lead, you are tasked with integrating this solution with your 
existing script. The appliance listens for a HTTP POST at https://fraudappliance.contoso.local/api/v1/addcall. 
The appliance will not return any data for your consumption. Modify your script to POST each call record 
(Name, phone number, department) to the fraud appliance, no output to the console is necessary although a 
confirmation is always good practice.
